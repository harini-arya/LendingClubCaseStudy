# LendingClubCaseStudy
## Objective
The primary objective of this case study is to employ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in past loan applicant data. By understanding how consumer attributes and loan characteristics influence the likelihood of loan default, we aim to uncover key indicators and driver variables.

## Data
The dataset contains information about past loan applicants, specifically whether they defaulted or not. This data serves as the foundation for our analysis, guiding us in making data-driven decisions.
